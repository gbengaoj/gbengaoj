## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I am Gbenga, an experienced data professional.

I enjoy building data models with SQL, Python, and Excel. And I also enjoy creating analytics with Power BI, Metabase, Looker Studio, and Excel. I am capable of building end-to-end business intelligence solutions that include data ingestion, modeling, pipeline automation, dashboards, and automated reports.

I currently work as a Business Intelligence Developer at [Izifin](https://www.izifin.com/), where we are providing FINTECHs with embedded intelligence solutions to help them make data-driven decisions faster.
